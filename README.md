# Purview

Azure Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. This new service helps organisation to understand the current state of their data.

I have created this repository with the idea of helping the community with some current challenges in Azure Purview. 

**NOTE** Please let me know if you face any issues with the walkthrough. Any feedback is also welcome :smile:
